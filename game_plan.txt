Chirag & Ethan:
	1)Do research for breaking down images via PIL (or maybe scipy or numpy)
Ali & Anna:
	2)Implement naive pattern string matching algorithm. If time allows try to implement the Boyer-Moore algorithm, but this isn't required.

-Documentation: do it while coding by using comments and formalize documentation later on
